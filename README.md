# hello-world
This is the first repository I created. It is being used to practice and learn GitHub.

This is the first file I've created in my effort to learn GitHub.  I intend to use GitHub for my Python class I'm taking 
through MIT.  

I've added some text here, too.  This is the new end of the message I'm writing to myself so I'm now ready to commit the file with the new changes.

UPDATE: I'm adding this to my readme as part of learning GitHub.  By adding this new text I should see a message when I commit the change.
