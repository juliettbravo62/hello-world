# hello-world
First repository created for practice

This is the first file I've created in my effort to learn GitHub.  I intend to use GitHub for my Python class I'm taking 
through MIT.  I intend to investigate if Spyder integrates with GitHub

This is the end of the message I'm writing to myself so I'm now ready to commit the file with the new changes.

UPDATE: I'm adding this area to my readme as part of learning GitHub.  By adding this new text I should see a message when I commit the change.
